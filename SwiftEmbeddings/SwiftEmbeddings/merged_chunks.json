But you can‚Äôt build software without having a programming language, so behind SwiftUI lies Swift itself: a powerful, flexible, and modern programming language that you‚Äôll use for all your SwiftUI apps.  \nAs Mark Twain once said, ‚Äúthe secret to getting ahead is getting started.‚Äù Well, you‚Äôre starting *now*, so we‚Äôre going to dive in and learn about variables, constants, and simple data types in Swift.  \n**Today you have seven tutorials to complete.** If you want to dive deeper into each topic there is optional further reading, but you don‚Äôt need to read that unless you want to and have the time. Regardless, there are a number of short tests to help make sure you‚Äôve understood key concepts.  \nI know, I know: the temptation is strong to continue on to watch more videos and take more tests beyond those linked below, but remember: don‚Äôt rush ahead!

First, not only can you avoid thinking about closures for the next few days, but once you‚Äôve had a break we‚Äôll start putting them into practice in real iOS projects. So, even if you aren‚Äôt 100% sure of how they work or why they are needed, it will all become clear ‚Äì stick with it!  \nAnyway, today‚Äôs topic is *structs*. Structs are one of the ways Swift lets us create our own data types out of several small types. For example, you might put three strings and a Boolean together and say that represents a user in your app. In fact, most of Swift‚Äôs own types are implemented as structs, including `String`, `Int`, `Bool`, `Array`, and more.  \nThese custom types ‚Äì users, games, documents, and more ‚Äì form the real core of the software we build.

Representation is the essence of programming.‚Äù  \nWhat‚Äôs more, structs are extremely common in SwiftUI, because every piece of UI we design is built on a struct, with lots of structs inside. They aren‚Äôt difficult to learn, but to be fair after closures almost *everything* seems easier!  \n**Today you have four tutorials to follow, where you‚Äôll meet custom structs, computed properties, property observers, and more.** Once you‚Äôve watched each video and optionally gone through the extra reading, there are short tests to help make sure you‚Äôve understood what was taught.  \n1.

But please remember to keep your code simple: just because a feature exists, it doesn‚Äôt mean you need to *use* it. As Martin Fowler wrote, ‚Äúany fool can write code that a computer can understand, but good programmers write code that humans can understand.‚Äù  \nI‚Äôve already said that SwiftUI uses structs extensively for its UI design.

A better idea is to convert the user‚Äôs input to a single base unit, then convert from there to the target unit.  \nSo, rather than writing code to convert from liters to milliliters, and from liters to cups, and from liters to pints, and so on, a better idea is to convert the user‚Äôs input into milliliters (the lowest common denominator), then convert from there to whatever output unit they want.", "total_chunks": 12, "source_file": "hackingwithswift.com_100_swiftui_19.md", "section_path": ["DAY 19", "Tips"], "char_count": 914, "word_count": 161, "chunk_file": "hackingwithswift.com_100_swiftui_19_0006.md"}, {"original_url": "https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/19", "scrape_date": "2025-09-25", "title": "100 Days of SwiftUI ‚Äì Day 19 ‚Äì Hacking with Swift", "chunk_index": 7, "content": "Third, as we have three user values here ‚Äìtheir input number, their input unit, and their output unit ‚Äìyou need to have three `@State` properties to store them all.

You can break your form up into sections if you want, but it‚Äôs not required.  \nFourth, the easiest way to store your conversion units is to have a simple string array, which you can loop over using something like `ForEach(units, id: \\.self)`.  \nFinally, if you‚Äôd like to be a bit fancy with the output number you display, try calling `.formatted()` on it ‚Äì e.g. `someDouble.formatted()`. This will cause iOS to format the number for printing, adding thousands separator and removing a lot of the noise from unnecessary decimal places.  \nGo ahead and get started now.

That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things.‚Äù", "total_chunks": 7, "source_file": "hackingwithswift.com_100_swiftui_28.md", "section_path": ["DAY 28", "Project 4, part 3"], "char_count": 1099, "word_count": 193, "chunk_file": "hackingwithswift.com_100_swiftui_28_0002.md"}, {"original_url": "https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/28", "scrape_date": "2025-09-25", "title": "100 Days of SwiftUI ‚Äì Day 28 ‚Äì Hacking with Swift", "chunk_index": 3, "content": "That‚Äôs where I want you to reach with SwiftUI ‚Äìto know that when you have a new project idea you can reach for part of project 1, part of project 3, part of project 4, and beyond, and already be 75% towards your goal.

If you do, you'll just overdesign and generally think it is more important than it likely is at that stage. Or worse, you might be scared away by the sheer size of the work you envision.*  \nIn writing this course, I‚Äôve already had people emailing me asking ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt I use X to solve a problem in project 1?‚Äù or ‚ÄúY would have been much better than Z in project 4.‚Äù They are probably right, but if I tried to teach you everything in project 1 you‚Äôd have found it overwhelming and unpleasant, so instead we built a small app. Then in project 2 we built a second small app. Then we built a third and a fourth, with each one adding to your skills.", "total_chunks": 8, "source_file": "hackingwithswift.com_100_swiftui_36.md", "section_path": ["DAY 36", "Project 7, part 1"], "char_count": 1023, "word_count": 194, "chunk_file": "hackingwithswift.com_100_swiftui_36_0002.md"}, {"original_url": "https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/36", "scrape_date": "2025-09-25", "title": "100 Days of SwiftUI ‚Äì Day 36 ‚Äì Hacking with Swift", "chunk_index": 3, "content": "Today you‚Äôll start project 7, which is still most definitely a small app. However, in the process you‚Äôll learn how to show another screen, how to share data across screens, how to load and save user data, and more ‚Äìthe kinds of features that really help take your SwiftUI skills to the next level.  \nThat doesn‚Äôt mean the app is perfect ‚Äì as you‚Äôll learn later, `UserDefaults` isn‚Äôt the ideal choice for what we‚Äôre doing here, and instead something like the much bigger and more complex SwiftData would be a better fit ‚Äì but that‚Äôs okay.

This is an area of SwiftUI we touched on just briefly in the previous project, but really lies at the core of practically every app you'll build.  \nAs you'll see, navigation is really broken down into two major types: navigation driven by user interaction, and *programmatic* navigation that you trigger yourself. Both are important, and you'll find yourself mixing the two freely.  \nOne thing you'll be exploring later on is the difference between using navigation and using sheets. Both matter, and you'll certainly use both on a regular occasion, but as you're working through these days I want you to think carefully about what each choice means and why you think you'd use one rather than the other ‚Äìas John Maxwell said, \"find your *why* and you'll find your *way*.\"  \n**Today you have three topics to work through, in which you‚Äôll learn a smarter, more flexible approach to navigation using navigation presentation values and the `navigationDestination()` modifier.**  \n- [Navigation: Introduction](/books/ios-swiftui/navigation-introduction)", "total_chunks": 7, "source_file": "hackingwithswift.com_100_swiftui_43.md", "section_path": ["DAY 43", "Project 9, part 1"], "char_count": 1176, "word_count": 182, "chunk_file": "hackingwithswift.com_100_swiftui_43_0002.md"}, {"original_url": "https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/43", "scrape_date": "2025-09-25", "title": "100 Days of SwiftUI ‚Äì Day 43 ‚Äì Hacking with Swift", "chunk_index": 3, "content": "- [Navigation: Introduction](/books/ios-swiftui/navigation-introduction)\n- [The problem with a simple NavigationLink](/books/ios-swiftui/the-problem-with-a-simple-navigationlink)\n- [Handling navigation the smart way with navigationDestination()](/books/ios-swiftui/handling-navigation-the-smart-way-with-navigationdestination)", "total_chunks": 7, "source_file": "hackingwithswift.com_100_swiftui_43.md", "section_path": ["DAY 43", "Project 9, part 1"], "char_count": 326, "word_count": 18, "chunk_file": "hackingwithswift.com_100_swiftui_43_0003.md"}, {"original_url": "https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/43", "scrape_date": "2025-09-25", "title": "100 Days of SwiftUI ‚Äì Day 43 ‚Äì Hacking with Swift", "chunk_index": 4, "content": "## How can this day be improved?  \nGreat job on finishing another day!

Think about it: you use an app for a while, you navigate to something precise, and then you leave the app for a while to do something else. Wouldn't it be nice if things just came back as they were when you relaunched the app later on, even if \"later on\" actually means a few days later?  \nThis is just one of today's topics, and I hope you take the time to get it right.

This is sometimes called ‚Äúscope creep‚Äù, and it‚Äôs something you‚Äôre going to face on pretty much every project you ever work on.

It might be on the same screen side by side with the photo, it might be shown or hidden using a segmented control, or perhaps it‚Äôs on a different screen ‚Äì it‚Äôs down to you. Regardless, you know how to drop pins, and you also know how to use the center coordinate of map views, so the only thing left to figure out is how to get the user‚Äôs location to save alongside their text and image.  \nAlthough I do want you to push your skills, I‚Äôm not *cruel*.

That might sound awfully pessimistic, but as John Lennon said ‚Äúlife is what happens when you‚Äôre busy making other plans‚Äù ‚Äìno one *wants* problems, but life has a habit of finding them anyway!  \nFortunately, Swift makes error handling straightforward and somewhat foolproof: it *requires* that we handle errors, or at least acknowledge that they might happen. If you don‚Äôt at least attempt to handle errors well, your code simply won‚Äôt compile.  \n**Today you have two tutorials to work through**, in which you‚Äôll meet default values for parameters and throwing functions, and then we‚Äôll summarize functions and look at checkpoint 4.
